### What’s Tracking Technology? 

Tracking technology is the convergence of several technologies that can be merged to create systems that track people, inventory, livestock or ­vehicle fleets.

**An example of a use case is People Tracking Technology:**

People Tracking includes detection, recognition, and predictive analytics of objects in motion. The complexity depends on the location of objects (i.e. store or street), the dimension of objects (i.e. a person or image), and details of the image (i.e. facial recognition or facial demographics).

Anonymous location-based data serves a wide variety of sectors, including Retail, Buildings, Hospitals, Transportation, and Smart Cities.

### Can Tracking Solutions can be divided into three broad categories?

It is Sensors Edge-Solutions, Device-Based Tracking, and Advanced Technologies.

Technologies include:

* Vision Analytics
* 3D Stereo Video Analytics
* Monocular Video Analytics
* Thermal Imaging
* Infrared Beams
* Time of Flight
* Structured Light.
* Raspberry Pi
* WiFi (Wide Area Network) Tracking
* UWB (Ultra Wide Band) | Radar Imaging
* BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Beacons
* GPS (Global Positioning System) Personal Tracker
* RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Tags & Tracking
* Bio-Metrics (Facial Recognition & Anonymous Demographics)
* 3D Spatial Learning (Augmented Reality)

### Shopper Tracking refers to tracking people (objects) in motion

People Counting refers to technologies solutions that “count” the number of people that either pass a virtual line or stay inside a specified zone.

In addition to detecting the object, the solution needs to recognize the object. There are different levels of object recognition.

{{< youtube lTYsa-CAxzc >}}

People Counting Solutions generate linear data if the object is detected, or not. Some technologies recognize the direction of the object (path), and provide In/Out counts and Dwell Time.

The business benefits for people counting relate to measuring the number of visitors, sales conversion, store comparison, and mall analytics.
