# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Image segmentation is one of the most important tasks in image analysis. This task can be used on an extensive range of application. However, some traditional techniques exhibit high computational costs, hindering their application because the complexity of such approaches is intrinsically related to the nature of the image. This work proposal explores a new area of application of the theory of complex networks until then little explored, the analysis of images. It is a relatively recent area of study that has attracted the attention of the scientific community and has been successfully applied to a large scale in the analysis of real-world problems."
